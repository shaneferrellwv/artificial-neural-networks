# Project Title

EEL4930 Project 3 - Artificial Neural Networks

## Description

This project experiments with approaches to the design process of artificial neural networks.
Various transfer learning, neural network architectures, hyperparameters, and
visualization practices for classification and regression tasks are explored with TensorFlow and Keras. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python 3 is required for this code
* Tensorflow is required
	* Tensorflow 2.7 kernel is suitable


### Executing program

* The code is intended to run on the University of Flordia supercomputer cluster Hipergator 3.0
* It has been tested using the Tensorflow-2.7 kernel

The code is comprised of four jupyter notebooks:
+ classification_training.ipynb
+ classification_test.ipynb
+ regression_training.ipynb
+ regression_test.ipynb

## Help

### Training

This code should seamlessly train and test these datasets of flower species and car images with minimal changes.

### Saved Model

The saved models that are reused in the test notebooks can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/m0kovn6s2t6h0bo/AAB62JWDZhgxg15UmvPkuKgra?dl=0).

Thank you Dr. Silva and Jackson for your patience and quick responses! 
Neural networks have been challenging to me and I feel much more comfortable with the Keras API now.
